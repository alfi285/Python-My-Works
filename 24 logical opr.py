#logical operator

#and
x = 10
print(x > 5 and x < 15)

#This returns True because 10 is greater than 5 AND 10 is less than 15.


#or
x = 10
print(x > 5 or x < 2)

#This returns True because one of the conditions are true.
#10 is greater than 5, but 10 is not less than 2.


#not
x = 10
print(not(x > 5 and x < 15))
#This returns False because not reverses the result of and.
